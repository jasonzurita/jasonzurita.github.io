# Summary

{ something about last post being about dependencies? }

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) has long been one of the two main, if not _the_ main, dependency management tool for Xcode platforms (e.g., iOS). Without a first class dependency management solution, the community stepped up in a big way and provided a great solution. Although I, and I am sure most people are, grateful for CocoaPods, the announcement of Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) (SPM) marked a new future for dependency management on Xcode platforms.

If you have an existing project that uses CocoaPods, here is a set of considerations and thoughts to help make the transition to SPM.
