<p>I am a self taught software developer with a variety of experience ranging from working as an Electrical Engineer designing safety systems for submarine nuclear reactors to working on both personal and commercial consumer facing iOS & Android apps. Currently, I work on internal and external iOS apps as an iOS Software Engineer at Warby Parker. Broadly, I am an electronic hobbyist/enthusiast, education advocate, maker, hacker, tinkerer, athlete, and loving husband/father/dog owner that has an interest in learning anything and everything.</p>
