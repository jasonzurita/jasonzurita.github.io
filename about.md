<p>I am a self taught software engineer with experience ranging from working as an Electrical Engineer designing safety systems for nuclear submarines to working on both personal and commercial consumer facing iOS & Android applications. Currently, I lead the Mobile Team (iOS & Android) at Driver Technologies. More broadly, I am an electronic hobbyist/enthusiast, education advocate, maker, hacker, tinkerer, athlete, and loving husband/father/dog owner that has an interest in learning anything and everything.</p>
